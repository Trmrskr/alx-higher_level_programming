# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

The tasks in this project, is linked to two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!

The first part, MySQLdb is used to connect MySQL database to execute SQL queries.

The second part, use the module SQLAlchemy, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).

The difference between the two is that, no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, your biggest concern will be "What can I do with my objects" and not "How this object is stored? where? when?". You won't write any SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, your code won't be "storage type" dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.

The objectives of these tasks include:
* How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
* How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
* What ORM means
* how to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
