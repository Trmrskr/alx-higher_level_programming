Following that, run mysql using 'sudo mysql'.

Create a new user, using the following command.

CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' BY 'password';

However you can use any of inbuilt mysql authentication feature listed below:

- mysql_native_password
- auth_socket
- authentication_plugin
- caching_sha2_password (default)


Grant user priviledge with the command.

The general syntax for granting priviledge is:
GRANT PRIVILEDGE ON database.table TO 'username'@'host';

However, you can specify the priviledges:
GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, INDEX, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Well, you can also grant all priviledge to user:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEDGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

At the end of it, flush priviledges by running:
FLUSH PRIVILEDGES;
